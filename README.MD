Returns Music that is supposed to play in the menu when you press Escape. That is it.

It uses the same music pool main menu has.

Should work with all mods out there. Doesn't have any requirements.

Works with EGUI (script is disabled if it detects EGUI).

## Credits:
- Rambito , Vilkki8  and Razolak for telling me that anomaly doesn't play music in the ESC menu once in game.
- EGUI for showing that it is indeed possible to play music in the ESC menu once in game.
- RavenAscendant for helping out with reading Ashes's code, and giving a rough code for reading UI XMLs.
- NLTP_ASHES for WG, as WG probably has everything you need to make any mod, including reading UI XMLs.
